# Setup
## Requirements
Make sure you have installed:
* Git
* XCode
* Android SDK
  * SDK API 23
  * Build tools 25.0.2
* node
  * yarn
  * react-native-cli
* ruby
  * bundler

## Installation
```bash
git clone git@github.com:Minishlink/DailyScrum.git
cd DailyScrum
bundle install
yarn
```

## Configuration
In the `environment` folder, copy `dist` files and replace values with the real ones.
`TRELLO_APP_KEY` can be found on your Scrumble server.

And now, you are ready, you can start working! (it's a `react-native run-ios` away)
